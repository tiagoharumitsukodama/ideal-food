# Ideal Food
Application to help decide what to eat.

# Introduction
Every day we wake up, eat something, wash dishes, work, exercise, and rest for another day. It is not so easy to be an adult, but one of the important parts is to cook something based on what we have in the refrigerator. Pasta or rice? Bread or soup? Maybe we can create some app to give us options to become healthy and avoid anxiety.

This application should help us decide what we could cook. To do this, we should tell the application what we have in the fridge, and then it will look for some options. The three best options should consider nutrition, price and easiness.
